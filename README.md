# IMSFrontend
The objective of this project is to replace manual work system by managers and employees: To replace manual work by managers and employees, a web-based application will be developed to ensure that the manual processes currently used by managers and employees become digital. This application/system will enable users to easily update, track, and access data from any device with internet connection.

Enable Real-time Visibility and Tracking: A dashboard will be made available to allow the display of real-time updates of the inventory levels. To make this work, barcode scanning will be integrated within the system to ensure tracking of items.

Ensuring that items cannot get lost: All actions related to inventory management will be linked to certain user accounts in the system. Which means that any movement or adjustment to stock will be traced back to a specific employee, increasing accountability and reducing the likelihood of theft or mishandling.

Introducing digital ordering: Customers will enable customers to place orders through the system from their device, offering greater flexibility and convenience. Admin will then be able to access and monitor the orders made on the system.
